Important Note Regarding the Executable (.exe) File
⚠️ Warning: The executable (.exe) file for this generator may be flagged as malicious by some antivirus programs, but it is 100% safe.

These are "False Positives" that commonly occur with executable files created by PyInstaller (the tool used to convert Python code into .exe files).

Why does this happen? Because PyInstaller bundles the Python interpreter and libraries with your code into a single file, which can sometimes resemble the behavior of certain malware in how they package components.

What does this mean? This does NOT mean the program is harmful. The source code is open and available on GitHub, allowing anyone to review it and verify that it is completely safe.

If you encounter this warning, you can safely ignore it or add the file to your antivirus program's exclusion list.
